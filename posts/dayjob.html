<h3> seven months at he museum /<h3>
	   
<body>
	<p>I worked for 7 months in France. During this time I got to travel, experience life as a museum guide, and meet people from all over the world. The bulk of my job was leading 45 minute guided tours of the bunkers that the German army built during their occupation in France. My guests could be anyone from children to people who had lived through that very occupation. I got to share the Canadian war experience with them, and help build a global understanding of the sacrifices made on the D-Day Beaches./<p>
